## Herwig Event Generation Tutorials

Our collaboration does a tutorial to show how one can simulate particle collisions at the LHC. The tutorial starts by exploring the anatomy of a proton-proton collision using simple runs, then leads into showcasing the features inside Herwig. A docker container is provided to run without installing.

## GPU Tutorials for the Particle Physicist

Based on my projects, I have written some tutorials on how common computations in particle physics can be paralllelised to run on GPUs. Most tutorials are in CUDA C++ and Python (using Numba for GPUs).

## Exam Guidance for Physics and Mathematics Students

Throughout my PhD, I was involved in marking first and second year exams. Every semester I marked one out of the four questions given to students. After four terms, and approximating 300 students per exams, I have marked about *1200 papers!*

Although I cannot state any details of which exams I marked or which question, The most useful piece of advice I can give to students (A-Level, BSc, MSc) when doing physics and maths exams is to use **DEMO**:

- **D**: Draw a diagram. It shows your understanding of the problem. If it is incorrect, it will inform the examiner of what you're trying to do, and give you error carried forward marks.

- **E**: Write the relavent Equations. There is always one or two marks for this. If students don't do it and get the answer right, they get full marks, but if they get it wrong, they get none. so better to have it then not!

- **M**: Do your maths neatly, with steps laid out. Examiners spend about 1-2 minutes per question of the script, so if it is unclear, they might genuinely miss marks that you should've received.

- **O**: Underline your Output. If all of the above fails, but you have the right answer, this will at least make the examiner think about the steps again, especially if it is very close to the right answer.
