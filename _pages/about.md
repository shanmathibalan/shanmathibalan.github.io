Hi! I am a student at the University of Manchester, doing a PhD in Particle Physics.

My PhD involves combining Monte Carlo Methods and Object-Oriented Programming to simulate particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I work on implementing advanced physics models in the [Herwig](https://herwig.hepforge.org/) collider simulation programme, which has been in use for over 40 years (in many incarnations).

I also work on hardware-acceleration. My supervisor and I have developed algorithms to parallelise simulations and released a programme for GPU-parallelised simulation called [GAPS](https://gitlab.com/siddharthsule/gaps), offering the speed of computer clusters on laptops and PCs.

On this page, you can find my publications and teaching resources. Links to my email, repositories, and blogs are below.
