Hi! I am a student at the University of Manchester, doing a PhD in Particle Physics.

My work involved using Monte Carlo Methods and Object-Oriented Programming to simulate particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. I work on the [Herwig](https://herwig.hepforge.org/) collider simulation programme, which has been in use for over 40 years (in many incarnations).

Specifically, I work on simulating the emissions of particles before and after a collision, which is the source of the hundreds of particles observed in every event. My PhD project involves applying Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics to improve the accuracy of these simulations in preparation for the next run of the Large Hadron Collider.

I also work on hardware-accelerated simulation code. My supervisor and I have developed algorithms to parallelise these simulations and released a programme for GPU-accelerated simulation called [GAPS](https://gitlab.com/siddharthsule/gaps), offering the speed of computer clusters on laptops and PCs.

On this page, you can find my publications and teaching resources. Links to my email, repositories, and blogs are below.
